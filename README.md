Known Bugs/Errors
   1. Link’s movement does not work correctly; he runs slightly too fast and can move diagonally.
   2. Link’s movement and damage invincibility flashing animations are playing to fast
   3. Cannot click on map to teleport yet
   4. Enemy item drops are buggy.
   5. Missing Power-up selection screen
   6. Items can bounce sometimes and end up triggering the desired effect more than once.
   7. Sometimes when you use the bomb, it uses up all of it.
   8. If build is broken, manually click on files that have errors and load them.  This is a VS code issue where it doesn't load it in automatically.
